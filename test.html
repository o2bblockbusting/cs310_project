                <h3>What can this site do for your Japanese language skills?</h3>
                <p>This site can help you reinforce old verb conjugations that are rarely used and can also help improve your conjugation speed. 
                    The site is broken up into multiple sections, with the most important being the practice section that tests your conjugation skills.
                    The examples tab is quite useful as it shows the rules for each conjugation form and should be referenced if you forgot one of the conjugations.
                    The statistics tab shows how accurate you are at conjugating verbs and what forms you have the most difficultly with.
                    Use this site as a resource to practice, but also check out the other useful Japanese learning tools linked below.

                    <a href="https://jisho.org">Jisho</a> is an excellent online dictionary that has many search options, example sentences, kanji details, and more. 
                    This is a must have that you are probably already using on a daily basis.
